This report provides the steps to generate results similar to Table 3,4 and Figure 2 of Sun et al. (2020+) using a simulated dataset. 

```{r}
library(reVAR)
library(survival)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
```

# Data preparation

The function `genData()` can be used to generate the simulated dataset. The ten possible data generating mechanisms in `genData()` correspond to Scenarios I-X in Sun et al. (2020+), Section 4.

```{r}
set.seed(123456)
dat <- genData(200, sce = "VAR3")
```

To use the function `reVAR()`, three data frames need to be prepared:

1. **nonEventDF1**: A data frame that records all the information for fitting the non-event visit model. Specifically, the first four columns must be `ID`, `Start`, `End`, `Status`:

  + `ID`: The subject ID for each observation. One subject can have multiple rows;
  
  + `Start`: The starting time for the interval;
  
  + `End`: The ending time of the interval;
  
  + `Status`: The status indicator, 1 = non-event visit, 0 = no;

  + The other columns are covariate values for the non-event model on the time interval `(Start, End]`.
  
In this example, there are three covariates (i.e., X1(t), X2(t), X3(t)) in the non-event model. **The covariates for the non-event visit model are continuously observed during the follow-up period**. The function `genData()` generates a data frame `nonEventDF1_s2`, which contains the above information and an additional column `Status2` (1 = event visit, 0 = no). The variable `Status2` needs to be removed when using `reVAR()`; `Status2` will be used later when fitting the model using the last-covariate-carrying-forward (LCCF) approach.

  
```{r}
nonEventDF1 <- subset(dat$nonEventDF1_s2, select = -Status2)
head(nonEventDF1)
```

The other two data frames record the event visit information. The covariates in the event model (i.e., Z1(t), Z2(t), Z3(t)) are only observed at events and non-event visits.

2. **nonEventDF2**: A data frame that records covariates for the event model **at non-event visits**. The first two columns must be ID and Time:
  
  + `ID`: The subject ID for each observation;
  
  + `Time`: Time zero and the non-event visit times for all the subjects;
  
  + The other columns are covariate values measured at `Time`.
  
```{r}
nonEventDF2 <- dat$nonEventDF2
head(nonEventDF2)
```  
  
3. **eventDF**: A data frame that records covariates for the event model **at event visits**. The first two columns must be ID and Time:
  
  + `ID`: The subject ID for each observation;
  
  + `Time`: Time zero and the event times for all the subjects;

  + The other columns are covariate values measured at `Time`.

```{r}
eventDF <- dat$eventDF
head(eventDF)
```  

# Model fittng

After the data frames have been prepared, one can apply the `reVAR()` function to obtain the coefficients in the event and non-event models. To obtain the 95% confidence intervals, the function `reVARBoot()` can be applied to produce bootstrapping confidence intervals. The function returns the estimations on `B` bootstrapped datasets.

## Using `reVAR()`

```{r}
fit <- reVAR(nonEventDF1, nonEventDF2, eventDF, 
             tau = 4.5, h = 0.3, baseline = TRUE)

bt <- reVARBoot(nonEventDF1, nonEventDF2, eventDF, 
                tau = 4.5, h = 0.3, baseline = TRUE, B = 500)

se.beta <- apply(bt$beta, 2, sd)
se.alpha <- apply(bt$alpha, 2, sd)

# The event model 
kable(data.frame(Variable = c("Z1","Z2","Z3"),
                 Coefficient = fit$beta, 
                 Lower = fit$beta - 1.96*se.beta, 
                 Upper = fit$beta + 1.96*se.beta))


# The non-event visit model 
kable(data.frame(Variable = c("X1","X2","X3"),
                 Coefficient = fit$alpha, 
                 Lower = fit$alpha - 1.96*se.alpha, 
                 Upper = fit$alpha + 1.96*se.alpha))
```

Finally, one can also obtain the point estimates and pointwise 95% confidence intervals of baseline rate functions of the event and non-event visit models when setting `base = TRUE` in the functions `reVAR()` and `reVARBoot()`.

```{r, fig.height=4}
se.M0 <- apply(bt$M0, 2, sd)
se.L0 <- apply(bt$L0, 2, sd)

pdata <- data.frame(t0 = fit$t0, 
                    M0 = fit$M0, L0 = fit$L0,
                    M0_L = fit$M0 - 1.96*se.M0,
                    M0_U = fit$M0 + 1.96*se.M0,
                    L0_L = fit$L0 - 1.96*se.L0,
                    L0_U = fit$L0 + 1.96*se.L0)


ggplot(pdata, aes(x = t0, y = M0)) +  geom_line() +  
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = M0_L, ymax = M0_U), alpha=0.2) +
  ggtitle("Cumulative baseline rate function in the event model")


ggplot(pdata, aes(x = t0, y = L0)) +  geom_line() +  
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = L0_L, ymax = L0_U), alpha=0.2) + 
  ggtitle("Cumulative baseline rate function in the non-event visit model")
```

## Other methods

To obtain the coefficient estimates in the event model using the methods in Li et al. (2016), we can apply the function `reVCAR()`. Only covariates in the event visit model are needed.

```{r}
beta.VCAR <- reVCAR(nonEventDF2, eventDF, tau = 4.5, h = 0.3)

bt2 <- reVCARBoot(nonEventDF2, eventDF,  tau = 4.5, h = 0.3, B = 500)

se2.beta <- apply(bt2, 2, sd)

kable(data.frame(Variable = c("Z1","Z2","Z3"),
                 Coefficient = beta.VCAR, 
                 Lower = beta.VCAR - 1.96*se2.beta, 
                 Upper = beta.VCAR + 1.96*se2.beta))
```

To obtain the coefficient estimates in the event model using the last-covariate-carrying-forward (LCCF) approach, the function `coxph()` can be used. In this example, the data frame `dat$nonEventDF1_s2` contains all the information needed for the LCCF approach. 

```{r}
fit3 <- coxph(Surv(Start, End, Status2) ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + cluster(ID),
              data = dat$nonEventDF1_s2)

coef3<- summary(fit3)$coefficients

kable(data.frame(Variable = c("Z1","Z2","Z3"),
                 Coefficient = coef3[,1], 
                 Lower = coef3[,1] - 1.96*coef3[,4], 
                 Upper = coef3[,1] + 1.96*coef3[,4]),
      row.names = FALSE)
```
